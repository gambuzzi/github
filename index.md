Open source software played a key role in last year's nuclear fusion breakthrough at the National Ignition Facility, where they succeeded in creating a controlled nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it took to cause. Other scientific fields, especially those that require the use of supercomputers, are also benefiting from open source software. It took some time before the nuclear industry started releasing open source software, due to the potential dangers of the technology, but the secrecy made research and education unnecessarily difficult.

# pg_hint_plan 

pg_hint_plan allows developers to tweak PostgreSQL execution plans using hints in SQL comments. Planners estimate the costs of each possible execution plan for a SQL statement then execute the plan with the lowest cost. While PostgreSQL's planner does its best to select the best execution plan using its cost-based optimizer, which uses data statistics rather than static rules, it is far from perfect as it doesn't count some data properties. pg_hint_plan has hints to control scan methods, join methods, join order, behavior on join, row number correction, parallel query configuration, and more.

# GPT-5 might arrive this summer as a “materially better” update to ChatGPT 

OpenAI is expected to release a major AI model, possibly GPT-5, sometime in mid-2024, likely during the summer. The new model will likely be a multimodel large language model with similar capabilities to GPT-4, but better. OpenAI is still reportedly training the model, after which it will go through internal safety testing to identify any issues before public release. Other issues, besides those that may come up from testing, may delay the launch.

# Signals for Tailwind CSS 

Signals for Tailwind CSS is a plugin that utilizes style queries via container queries to reactively enable custom states that can be consumed by descendants in the DOM. It reduces development effort and the need to compose a chain of variants. Signals for Tailwind CSS is useful for simplifying the application of styles based on ancestor states, improving developer experience with a more declarative API, and reducing the need for complex selector chaining and arbitrary targeting. Browser support for style queries is still limited, so Signals for Tailwind CSS may not be suitable for projects that require broad compatibility.
